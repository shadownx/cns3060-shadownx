Project1 - Make
=================

John Archer

So far the hardest part was getting used to GITHUB and the different interfaces used to make changes.  
It took a little bit to remember to include the ( int argc, char* argv[] ) into the initial int line  
to get the arguments being passed into the program from the command line or Makefile to be accessable  
for output or print statements.
